# Student CMS (Pure Ruby Console App)

A console CMS for **students**, **courses**, and **enrollments** with JSON storage.
- Pure Ruby (no Rails)
- RSpec tests with **P2P** and **F2P** tags

## Quick Start
```bash
bundle install
bin/cms
bundle exec rspec
```

## P2P vs F2P
- P2P (pass-to-pass): already passing on base.
- F2P (fail-to-pass): capture historical bugs; should fail on base, pass after fix.
